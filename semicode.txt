Semicode - semantic unicode

An experiment to extend unicode with the ability to define semantic webs.

Semicode is a superset of unicode. It introduces two new features:

- The 'link' control character, which can be used to link three words together into a triple.
- The 'embed' control character, which defines a variable-length block of bytes, which may itself be semicode.

Any valid unicode document is a valid semicode document. This document is written in semicode and displayed with a semicode editor.

This is a block of bytes, inserted with the embed control character:

16:a76808da81498ebca5d4ab5e100b2272

It's 16 random bytes (a UUID), shown as a single block whose color is based on the hash of the bytes.
Nodes in semicode's semantic web are intended to be globally unique, so UUIDs are a good fit for representing each unique concept to be expressed.

This is the link control character:



It's used to link three blocks/words into a semantic web triple:

16:b824a2845bb58ae85f3761ded628196e16:bd80e99eac1dd0d153f5951b7101202a16:8e76fe9dfdee7cc89b020a5255590381

This UUID can be used to control the appearance and layout of all text and blocks that follow it:

16:815400a6d2abb412ebf3c5306a8ddbdftext_label_vialabel

Now linking via 'label' will make every instance of that block have the given text label.

16:8e76fe9dfdee7cc89b020a5255590381labelDog

The meaning of the triple shown earlier is now more clear:

16:b824a2845bb58ae85f3761ded628196e16:bd80e99eac1dd0d153f5951b7101202a16:8e76fe9dfdee7cc89b020a5255590381
